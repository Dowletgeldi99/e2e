## About The Project

1. This app allows users to manage projects and tasks visually using the board. One board represents one project and contains one or more lists. 
2. User can drag-n-drop to change the order of lists, the order of tasks inside the list, and also move task from one list to another as well.

## Application Features

Allow user to,
- create a new list
- edit list name
- delete list
- rearrange the lists in the board using drag and drop

- create new tasks
- edit task 
- delete task
- rearrange the tasks in the list by drag and drop

## What I learned 

* Using a virtual DOM can reduces rendering costs and simplify the process of connecting UI and logic.
* How to use Vuex as a state management method (VueX serves as a centralized store for all the components with rules ensuring their state can only be mutated in a predictable way).
